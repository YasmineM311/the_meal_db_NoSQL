The meal database https://www.themealdb.com/ is an open, crowd-sourced database of Recipes from around the world that offers a free JSON API. The raw JSON data fetched from the API was stored in a Mongodb database, but wass not ideal for querying. In this project, we modify document structure into a more query-friendly one using PyMongo. In addition, we conduct an analysis where we answer some questions about cuisines, ingredients and meal categories!
